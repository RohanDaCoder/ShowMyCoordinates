# Show My Coordinates

"Show My Coordinates" is a lightweight Minecraft plugin designed to enhance your multiplayer experience by allowing players to easily share their current coordinates in the global chat. With simple command aliases like `/show`, `/sc`, `/s`, `/showc`, and `/showcoordinates`, this plugin makes it effortless for friends to find each other in your SMP (Survival Multiplayer) world.

## Key Features
- **Global Coordinate Sharing:** Instantly share your coordinates with everyone in the server chat.
- **Multiple Command Aliases:** Use various commands to access the same functionality, making it flexible and user-friendly.
- **Universal Access:** All players have permission to execute this command, fostering collaboration and communication.

## Warnings
- **No Confirmation:** This plugin does not require confirmation before sharing your coordinates, so be mindful of sharing your location.
- **Global Sending:** Coordinates are sent to all players on the server. Use this feature wisely, as it could reveal your position to others in the game.

## Developer Note
This plugin was made by **me** for my personal SMP and was not originally intended for public release. However, I've decided to share it in case anyone else finds it useful for similar functionality.
